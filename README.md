🥞You have propably heard about "CODE NERO", the new sniperbot. In this video I show you a simple front run deployment in Solidity which automatically locates any liquidity added to a BSC token, immediately buy and sell at profit.🥞

🥞Current parameters of this contract is that 10% of profit automatically reenters the front-run pool, and automatically transacts back to your wallet 90% of the profit.  The remaining pool keeps front running for profit, until you transaction "Action" function in Remix🥞

🚨⚠️🚨NOTE: This contract have been designed for Binance Smart Chain (BEP20)  and won't work with Ethereum mainnet. We have a tutorial coming out on that next week! Stay tuned!
